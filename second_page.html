            <h1>BMW M Performance models</h1>
            <p class="text">

                Recently (2012) BMW has introduced a new category for 'M' cars, which was branded as the 'M'
                Performance. They are the first M diesel cars that BMW produces.
                <br>
                To date this includes the M550d in touring and saloon variants, the X6 M50d and X5 M50d which all share
                a 381 bhp 740NM triple turbo diesel engine, the former pair are only LHD drive markets currently due to
                the xDrive layout in the F10 series not being compatible with RHD markets (a RWD F10 M550d was mentioned
                by Auto Express but has not been confirmed). Official figures put the M550d xDrive’s 0-to-62-mph time at
                4.7 seconds and top speed at 155mph (limited).The first petrol M Performance car is the M135i which is a
                320 bhp 1 series car. M135i is available with rear- or all-wheel drive.

            <h1>M-Cars vs. M-badged cars</h1>

            <p class="text">
                There are several BMW models which BMW Motorsport made changes on, without them becoming M-Cars. This
                succession of styling (M-tech I, M-tech II) and performance cues came from BMW Motorsports; e.g. BMW
                530i M packet or 325i M packet etc.
                <br>
                Vehicles which have been modified by BMW Motorsport, but are not full M Cars, may feature "M" badges,
                whilst full M Cars will have "M" badges with the model number (e.g., "M4" or "M5"). Two exceptions would
                be the M Roadster and M Coupe models, both Z3, Z4 and 1 Series variants, which only have an "M" badge
                with no number displayed on the trunk. These cars are full M Cars.
