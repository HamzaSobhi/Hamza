				   The first racing project was BMW’s 3.0 CSL.
                    <br>
                    After the success of BMW M products like BMW 3.0 CSL in racing venues and the growing market for
                    high
                    
					
					
                    sale to the public was the M1, revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978. The M1, however, was more
                    of a
                    racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver. The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979
                    release of the M535i, which was a high performance version of BMW’s popular 5 Series mid-size sedan.

                    In 1993 BMW Motorsport GmbH changed their name to BMW M GmbH.
                    <br>
                    BMW Motorsport GmbH supplied the 6.1 litre V12 DOHC 48 valve engine that powers the McLaren F1,
                    which,
                    like its engine supplier and manufacturer, has enjoyed plenty of racing success, famously winning
                    the 24
                    Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the first year of competition for the GTR racing variant.

                        t present, BMW M has offered modified versions of nearly every BMW nameplate, except for the Z1,
                        7
                        Series flagship luxury sedan and the X1 compact crossover SUVs. There is no BMW M version of the
                        7
                        Series, as BMW did not want its flagship saloon to be powered by a high-revving engine, and as
                        the
                        recent top-performing versions (usually the BMW 760Li) have V12 engines which while powerful are
                        considered too heavy for a sporty offshoot. So far the unofficial "BMW M7" is the Alpina B7,
                        which
                        is
                        produced on BMW's assembly line though its engine and finishing touches are done by auto tuner
                        Alpina. However, as BMW M shifted to turbocharged engines, there are rumors that
                        there is
                        an in-house BMW M7 in the works, and it is speculated that its performance may exceed that of
                        the
                        BMW
                        760Li and Alpina B7
